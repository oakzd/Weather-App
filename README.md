## Installation 🛠️

Follow these steps to install and set up the **Weather Checker** project:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:
- **Python 3.6 or above**  
  [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- An active **[OpenWeather API key](https://openweathermap.org/api)** (you’ll need to sign up and generate a key if you don’t already have one).

### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository from GitHub using the command below:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/oakzd/weather-app.git
```

### Navigate into the newly created directory

Run command below:
```bash
cd weather-app
```

### Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

A virtual environment helps isolate your project dependencies from the global Python environment. 
Create and activate a virtual environment using the following commands:

For macOS/Linux:
```bash
python3 -m venv weather_env
source weather_env/bin/activate
```
For Windows::
```bash
python -m venv weather_env
weather_env\Scripts\activate
```

### Install Dependencies
The required Python libraries for this project are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them by running:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all the necessary dependencies, including:
- **Requests** : for making API calls
- **Tabulate**: for creating clean, formatted tables
- **Colorama**:: For colorful terminal output


### Configure the Project
The required Python libraries for this project are listed in the requirements.txt file. Install them by running:
```python
# config.py
API_KEY = "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY"
```
Replace "YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY" with your actual API key. 
Keep this file secure and avoid committing sensitive info to public repositories.

## Usage 🚀
With everything set up, run the application from your terminal:
```bash
python main.py
```
Once ran you will see the following...
